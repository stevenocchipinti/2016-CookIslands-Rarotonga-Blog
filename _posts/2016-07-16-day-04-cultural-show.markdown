Rode down to the police station to do the motorcycle test.
I failed the written test, took notes on where I went wrong and will retest tomorrow at 8:30am
Stopped at a cafe for brunch and had muesli, fruit and yogurt
Stopped past the hire place to switch my scooter
Back to the hotel, asked Rangi about what to do tonight, she suggested the Highland Paradise show and booked it for me.
Due to a cancelled flight all the buses were really busy so one of the organisers drove to the hotel especially to pick me up! Very kind
Read my book by the pool until pickup at 5:00
Pickup took me to the mountain site about 500 meters above sea level
Was there a little early so I walked around and took some photos and looked through their museum until the other buses arrived.

We went inside, got a welcome cocktail
Introduction speech and then a tour around the site
Vaka were the long catermarans they used to go from island to island and could go 20knots
Expert navigators using the stars, etc.
Look out rocks to guard the site
Cooking food in an umu with banana leaves and heated volcanic rocks, used to take 4 hours to cook + prep time
Marai is a place or worship and meeting place
Ceremony, no photos allowed out of respect
Each level of steps was for different generals, king, parliament, etc.
A rock up the top of the mountain points to a particular star, captain's would train there before going to the sea
Back inside for dinner, a massive feast with food that was cooked in the underground umu's

Also tried the local beer, Matatu. They have a pale ale (what I had, pretty good) and a lager
Cultural dancers and drummers to tell stories of their history
Missionaries arrived and introduced Christianity
Made the dancers less provocative and wear their dresses higher
Converted the savage, canabal king to Christianity
The host was entertaining and pretty funny
The band and dancers were good and one of them was Mr. Hopeless, the bus driver!
I'm pretty sure the two kids from the tourism commercials were also in the band!
