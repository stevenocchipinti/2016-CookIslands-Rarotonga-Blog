Two ladies in the office, service lady and maintenance guy all knew that I slept all day! Haha
Got a surprise welcome breakfast and some information

Realised just how close the water is, literally across the road! That's why it's so easy to hear the waves crashing from my room!
Chatted with Johnny (the maintenance guy) for ages and caught the bus into town.
Got cash out and walked around for a bit, there were a few cafes, touristy shops, a chemist, a phone place and two grocery places and all really close to the beach (everything is close to the beach here)

A local sim card cost $25 with no included credit, then data is $10/100MB or $25/300MB, but I decided I didn't want to spend that much on internet when my main goal was to relax, disconnecting from normal life is probably a healthier choice.
Back at the hotel, Johnny mentioned my clock was probably not correct, but he didn't have a clock on him at the time.
My phone was still in flight mode, so i did something I haven't had to do in at least a decade, I asked someone for the time!
It's amazing how I'm so used to having access to any piece of information I want at the touch of a button in this information age that it kind of felt good to be disconnected for a while.
I checked what time the bus was going to depart, the next one was an anticlockwise bus which would be the quickest way back to the hotel, so I quickly got some groceries and meat and caught the bus back to the hotel.

The bus drivers were both entertaining, singing songs and cracking jokes the whole way.
He warned us not to go swimming for the next two days, when someone asked why he said because we'll get wet!
Sat by the pool and read my book for a while
Continued reading inside, made a sandwich and ate a pack of burger rings! Definitely on holiday mode!
Got an early night sleep
