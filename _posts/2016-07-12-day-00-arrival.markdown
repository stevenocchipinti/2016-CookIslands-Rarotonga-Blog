Delays at Melbourne airport
Still lots of time to kill at Auckland
Transferred without a second boarding pass, killed 5-6 hours before getting one from the gate, which wasn't announced until 1hr before departure
Raro airport is tiny!

Humid weather, slightly raining
Confusion about dates and names (crossed the international date line)
Welcomed with a flower necklace

Got into a mini van with other tourists, 70kmph in a 50kmph zone and check engine light on
Got into my room and will sort out booking stuff in the morning (it's 2:45am)
There are "jet blast zone" and "stop when jets take off" signs on the road near the airport,
Bungalow is big

There are gecko's around, something moved and scared me, haha
Rangi (pronounced rungy?) was nice, said it was chilly outside, except I was sweating!
Straight to bed!
