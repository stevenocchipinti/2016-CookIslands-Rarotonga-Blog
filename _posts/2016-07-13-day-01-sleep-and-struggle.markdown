Slept in until 3pm! It's all catching up with me!
Raining, the sound is relaxing and is putting me back to sleep
Internet is $9/30MB, pretty pricey

By the time I left, it was dark and still raining
Book said there was food to the left or right.
I picked right, walked for a while in the dark and rain with an umbrella. There were quite a few dogs barking at me as I went past.
Found an inn, but could only see accommodation rooms, so I turned around.
Saw a person smoking and asked them for directions to somewhere I could eat.
Turns out just to the left of the hotel was a small shop and they had a cafe, minimum $20 so I ordered a seafood platter and a coke.

It was fairly greasy, but i was too hungry to care.
The little hut's roof was leaking from everywhere, but I sat up against the counter with the company of a cat and some terrible American reality TV show.
I spoke to a local who spent 18 years in Melbourne but is back home with his family.
He told me how it is possible to survive without jobs here because they live off the land, but that said most people still need an income. He worked at the airport doing luggage stuff.
He also recommends going to the island and doing the traditional BBQ where they cook food underground.
It was a deep fried and pretty heavy
