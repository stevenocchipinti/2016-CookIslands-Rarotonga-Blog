Made bacon and eggs again for breakfast
Took some photos of the garden in front of my room, this made me want to do more photography!
Packed my bag with photography gear and put my tripod on my back
Headed towards the sign I saw for gardens
Dark clouds and slightly raining
Took a side road, dirt track, scooter off road
Found the gardens, hidden spirit cafe
Had a delicious fruit and chicken salad with coconut Mayo

Walked around the gardens and took macro photos

Enquired about kite surfing, a little expensive, wind will be sufficient from Thursday onward
Also booked paddleboard yoga for Wednesday
Enquired about a massage
Went to LBV bakery for a snack and a cup of tea
Went back to the massage place for a back, neck and shoulders massage
Waited around for the night market to start
Got some cash out ($5.50 ATM fee!)
Got a Marlin salad, berry smoothie and choc-berry brownie, pretty tasty!

Didn't have a jumper or a helmet, so I left just as the sun was setting with my sunglasses as goggles
Got home, prepared burgers, nap, shower, book, bed
