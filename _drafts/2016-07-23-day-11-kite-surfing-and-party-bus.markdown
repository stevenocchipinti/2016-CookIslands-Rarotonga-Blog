THIS POST GOT MESSED UP, REFER TO EVERNOTE!



Time mix up, I thought 12, they thought 9
Stopped by Rehab to pay for the party bus
The guy said you can't bring alcohol on the bus, but you can mix some into a bottle of soft drink and sneak it on!
Had fruit and muesli with a smoothie for breakfast at LBV (bakery)

Went to the beach, found kitesup people
Got a wet suit and a harness
Marlin, a Swedish kitesup instructor taught me how to setup the kite (inflation, setting up the lines, red handle on the left, blue handle on the right)
Learned the safety features, first let the handle go, second pull the release on the harness, last pull the release on the leash
Talked about what good weather conditions are (inward wind, flat water, clear of others, not hiding behind a &quot;wind shadow&quot; from an island, &gt; 15 knots, etc.)
Went through the theory of the wind window
Walked out into the lagoon, did an assisted launch, moving the kite to the sides (down to 10 and 2), one handed control and walking with the kite, then body dragging upwind by taching and then downwind by doing violent figure 8's
Marlin said I picked up the kite control pretty fast, but I did struggle with the last part. Wherever I got a bit of power going, I would lose control a bit and either get out of rhythm or crash the kite, but other than that I did ok.

I booked in for another lesson tomorrow at 12, hopefully in not too tired from the party bus pub crawl which finishes up around 2am
After that I was pretty hungry so I went deli-licious, which is next to kitesup, just opposite LBV and had a salmon bagel, not sure if it was just because I was so hungry, but it was really good!<en-media type="image/jpeg" hash="2961db2f9738b27342ae8d05c1a11cd4"/>
I also got a chilled nu (coconut) to go with it and when I was done they broke it open for me to scoop the meat out. I only ate a little bit of the meat so I took the rest home for a snack.<en-media type="image/jpeg" hash="b436a2e7bac556e735eadf08348eea0c"/>
The cafes around here always have interesting tokens for you to hold as a token until your food arrives. In Melbourne it's normally just a number, but here I've seen different types of colored rocks and a variety of different toys! That's what the deer toy is in case you're wondering!
I had another quick look around for a spray jacket but no luck, so then headed home to have a shower and prepare for a big night of partying!

The bus was meant to arrive at 8:45pm, so I waited out the front in the rain, but it didn't arrive until 9pm. When it did it was pretty obvious though, bright lights, loud music and no windows, it was all just open with people hanging out dancing and singing!<en-media type="video/mp4" hash="191d24fb064ed625b677077491401793"/>
The first two hours where spent going to the popular bars around the avarua area including avianas, hula bar, Heidi's and one more that i can't remember the name of before going to Rehab for the last few hours. Rehab is there islands main nightclub and is open until 2am.
It was a pub crawl bus, so even though we were only at some of the bars for about 15 minutes, I had a beer at each one and even got in a tequila shot and danced for the majority of the time!
The bus would let us out and then do a really loud whistle to call us back to go to the next place.

I met some pretty cool people, one guy was looking to move from Rarotonga to Melbourne permanently and I met a couple of guys running their own IT businesses, one making apps and another running an ISP and I bumped into my kite surfing instructor and one of the girls from the kitesup shop. I even saw the first girl I met at Muri beach too, Kelly, but she snobbed me off, I guess she didn't want me cramping her style!
While I was talking to the girl from kitesup, I heard someone saying we need to get back to the bus, but I couldn't hear the whistle. I saw the group getting a photo taken, so I continued chatting. After a minute or two I thought I'd check for people with wristbands from the party bus and I saw a couple going out the front, so I joined in with them and asked if they were on there party bus, they said yes and asked me which one I'm on. That's when I realised their bands where a different color to mine and their tour guide said my bus had already gone!
He was kind enough to squeeze me on to his bus as they went to their next destination, but he said the buses don't always go to the same places.
When we got there, I saw the bus I came on and the guy pointed me in the right direction! I thanked him and eventually joined back in with my group!
It got to about 12:45 and I was tired and the back of my ankles were killing me. I'm not sure if they got cut from the wind surfing today or the dancing or from having sand in there for so long, but every step I took became more painful so I decided to leave a bit early. The bus would have taken me home at 2am and I had already paid for it, but I decided to take a taxi instead. It was going to cost me $30 to get home, which was a bit expensive, but I ended up sharing it with a bunch of other people including one girl who had way too much to drink and could barely stand!
In the end the cab still charged too much, he asked everyone for $10 and there were a few of us, but it's better than the $30 I was originally going to pay!
