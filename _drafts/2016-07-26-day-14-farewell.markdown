Bite time cafe, Ika Mata with Brin from kitesup
Got coconut bread from the bakery
Returned scooter
Had a chat with Jack and Kim from The Dive Center at the hotel
Had a nap
Had a chat with Jane and thanked her for all the help
Got taking with the new guests at the hotel, a big group of families!
Used most of my remaining food (steak, potatos, tomatoes, cucumber, cheese, beers, etc.) and had a BBQ with them
Finished up around 8:30, too late to go to the shipwreck hut, they close at 9:00.
Washed dishes, cleaned up, showered, packed my suitcase
I managed about half an hour sleep
Transfer guy arrived 20 minutes early
Picked up another family on the way

The screen said the flight was delayed by an hour, but I only had an hour to transfer at Auckland, so I thought I was going to have a hard time, but when I got to the counter, the screen has updated and it was running on time.

After my bags were checked in, I got a toasty and a muffin from a small stall nearby and went through security. It was a very simple process here.

I got to the gate and still had more than 2 hours to kill. The recommendation is normally to get to the airport 3 hours early for international flights, but that doesn't seem necessary here!

I sat there listening to music when I saw a familiar face, it was Sarah that I had met in Muri beach the day of Captain Tama's Lagoon Cruise.
We ended up chatting and the time went much faster!

Don't drive and Pokemon sign!
