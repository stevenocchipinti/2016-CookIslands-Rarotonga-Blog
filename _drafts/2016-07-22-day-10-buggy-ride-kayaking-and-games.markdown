Being woken up by shouting @ 1:30-2:30, a neighbor telling the party bus goers to be quiet
Rode to muri for the buggy tour
Got there and realised I left the voucher at the hotel
Drove the buggy through town, stopped at a coconut oil place, showed us how they open coconuts and extract the oil and make skin products, cooking oils, etc.
Took the buggies through back roads and got muddy!
A guy took a wrong turn and we all followed, ended up going through a flooded road that was like a small river then had to backtrack
Went to the waterfall, lots of mosquitos, water was flowing but hadn't been for about 5 months before hand
Went to the abandoned Sheridan, apparently there were two offers to build casinos, but they were rejected, the third offer was a big hotel by some Italian guy. Turns out he wasn't from the Sheridan and had mafia connections, he was using it for money laundering. It was practically complete with furniture and everything, just needed staff to run it, but they extradited the man and in the mean time there was no one running it so there locals took everything from inside and it was abandoned.
It was really muddy through there! We went to a driving range, we each had 6 shots and if we got a hole in one our ticket price would be refunded. Apparently this happened around 10 times in the last few months, but no one from our group got it.
While we were golfing, they hosed down our buggies and then we gave our lunch order to our guide and her ordered for us at the Moore's cafe(?) and we drive down there, after lunch and headed back to the hotel where we started.

There were dark clouds lingering over the mountain, so I thought I'd go back to the hotel to get there voucher while I still could, even though I was covered in mud! About half way there it started raining. Got to the hotel, grabbed the voucher and headed back, by the time I reached muri again the weather was clear. Not sure if it was only raining on that side of the island or if the weather has just changed so frequently. There were still dark clouds over the mountain so it was hard to tell. I dropped off the voucher and headed to the beach to wash all the mud off. Once I was somewhat clean, I drive around to kitesup to check the weather for tomorrow kite surfing lesson and they said it should be around 20 knots, which is good for kite surfing.

Even though the dark clouds where still over the mountain, I thought I'd try my luck and I hired a kayak from Captain Tama's. It cost $15 and I wanted to see what the protective reef was like so I started the trek over there. As I got closer, I saw some people standing on what looked like rocks with huge waves crashing in front of them.
The protective reef has a big rock wall that literally borders with the ocean. I didn't get too close in fear that my kayak would get caught on the rocks and headed back around to the small island where we went for Captain Tama's Lagoon tour. By the time I had made it there I was pretty tired and pulled up ok the sand bar. There was a girl relaxing on the sand bar so I stopped for a chat. She was from Germany and was here on holiday after finishing her master's in psychology. After a nice chat, I headed back to shore and returned my kayak.

It was about 4:30 by this stage and the night market was going to start at 5:00, so I went to get some fuel for the scooter and waited around the market for all the stalls to set up.
I wanted to try Ika Mata, which is raw fish in coconut cream and they had it at the market for $6. It wasn't enough for a full meal, but I thought this time I could have a bunch of smaller dishes instead of one big one, so I bought that, some kebab skewers (the most popular thing at the market) and some fried rice.
The Ika Mata was delicious and the kebabs and rice was really nice too. They put mushroom sauce over the kebabs and rice, mushroom sauce is everywhere here! I also got another coconut drink from the same place as last time, but this time instead of banana, he mixed passion fruit, which was also really nice!

While I was eating I got taking to an engineering student from the US who was here doing her scuba diving licence certification. She was new to the island so I told her about some of the things I had done here that I enjoyed. One of those things was riding around the island on the scooter, but she wasn't keen on that and had been taking the bus everywhere. After we had finished eating, I gave her a lift back to her hotel and headed home.

When I got back, I dumped my stuff in the doorway and went over to the outdoor tap to wash all the sand off my shoes and got speaking to my neighbors again who were eating at the gazebo area. They had cooked a big serving of freshly caught fish and actually looked for me to offer me some, which was very nice of them! They were about to play cards and invited me to join in, so I grabbed a beer and ended up playing a game called "up and down the river" with them until 11:00pm.

After that I went inside to have shower and prepare for another early morning ride out to muri tomorrow for my first kite surfing lesson!
